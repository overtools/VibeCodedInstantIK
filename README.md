# THIS ADDON WAS NOT CREATED BY US AND WILL NOT BE UPDATED
This addon is severly vibe-coded and unmaintainable. If it works for you, cool. Otherwise, nothing we can do.

This repo only exists to:
- Host the community patch outside of Discord.
- Have functioning git history (instead of zip files).

The original repository of this addon: https://github.com/sxlar3d/Overwatch-Ik-Rig-Blender-Addon.

The "Community patch" was posted by a user on Discord: https://discordapp.com/channels/346445737367699456/686703961717342426/1303125739742298256
